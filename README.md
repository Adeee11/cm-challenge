Created a swagger.yaml file to document the backend API's . And added functionality to allow users to purchases credits inside the websites and then order reports using the credits.

### 3. Ucruise (https://www.ucruisesydney.com.au)
In this a project i worked in a team to migrate the php based website to GatsbyJS website. I handled the migration of blog posts and payment gateway. This helped in decreasing load time of the website and increased customer retention and more bookings. It is a website where user can book a Boat for parties or any other reason.

## Inspiration
I am inspired the following open source projects
### 1. Rocket Chat (https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat)
I am currently inspired by the project because it uses meteor.js and webrtc for building a real time chat system which can concurrently handle many users.
### 2. @material-ui/core (https://github.com/mui/material-ui)
This library inspired me to create a mono repo of components and build my own ui library for a custom project in which i had to create reuseable components. The themeing functionality of this library is very useful
### 3. Animation (https://codepen.io/roydigerhund/pen/jqJvWK)
The following codepen helped me in learning and practicing animation and keyframes for building a CSS spinner of an application.
### 4. React Native (https://reactnative.dev/)
This library allows to build cross platform mobile Apps using React . It has very good support. I learned it while building a Mobile app for a Client.

## Focus
If I was given time and resources to learn at CM . I would focus on learning more about trading platforms like wealthsimple or kucoin and build a MVP. I want to learn how they do instantaneous million trades in a second without downtime and How they handle multiple order books and manage the stock price , etc.
